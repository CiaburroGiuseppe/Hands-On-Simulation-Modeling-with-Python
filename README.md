This is the code repository for [Hands-On Simulation Modeling with Python](https://www.packtpub.com/in/data/hands-on-simulation-modeling-with-python?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781838985097), published by Packt.

**Develop simulation models to get accurate results and enhance decision-making processes**

## What is this book about?
Developers working with the simulation models will be able to put their knowledge to work with this practical guide. You will work with real-world data to uncover various patterns used in complex systems using Python. The book provides a hands-on approach to implementation and associated methodologies to improve or optimize systems

This book covers the following exciting features: <First 5 What you'll learn points>
* Gain an overview of the different types of simulation models
* Get to grips with the concepts of randomness and data generation process
* Understand how to work with discrete and continuous distributions
* Work with Monte Carlo simulations to calculate a definite integral
* Find out how to simulate random walks using Markov chains
